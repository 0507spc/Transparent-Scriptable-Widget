# Transparent Scriptable Widget
This code allows you to easily customize a "transparent" widget (one that blends into your iOS home screen background) using the Scriptable app - without knowing any code.

## How it works
Here's the breif summary of how it works:
1. Download the [Scriptable app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188?ign-mpt=uo%3D4) from the iOS App Store.
2. Copy the code from mz_transparent_widget.js into a new script.
3. Optionally change any of the widget settings near the top of the file.
4. Run the script by tapping the purple icon or hitting the "play" button in the code view.
5. On your home screen, add a Scriptable widget. Enter the widget settings, and choose the script name.

That's the simple summary of how to get started. I'm planning to add more information here soon!
